# Invisible-close-Button
The invisible close button is a designer's way of adding an element of surprise and suspense to your digital experience. Can't find the button to exit a window? No worries! This invisible gem is like a game of hide-and-seek that you never signed up for. It's always lurking, yet never visible, challenging your patience and eye for detail. Who needs easy navigation when you can have a stealthy close button that keeps you on your toes?
